# Payment-First Listing Flow Implementation

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**

The screenshot showed that the driveway listing flow was still using the old driver's license verification as the first step, instead of the new payment-first approach where:
1. **Payment setup should be first** (for address verification)
2. **Driver's license verification should be optional** (for higher tiers)

## 🔧 **Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Updated Index Page to Use Tiered Space Creation Flow**

**Before:**
```typescript
import { AISpaceListingModal } from "@/components/spaces/ai-space-listing-modal";

const [aiSpaceListingModalOpen, setAiSpaceListingModalOpen] = useState(false);

<AISpaceListingModal 
  open={aiSpaceListingModalOpen}
  onOpenChange={setAiSpaceListingModalOpen}
/>
```

**After:**
```typescript
import { TieredSpaceCreationFlow } from "@/components/spaces/tiered-space-creation-flow";

const [tieredSpaceCreationOpen, setTieredSpaceCreationOpen] = useState(false);

{tieredSpaceCreationOpen && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 flex items-center justify-center p-4 z-50">
    <div className="w-full max-w-4xl max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto">
      <TieredSpaceCreationFlow
        onListingCreated={(listingData) => {
          setTieredSpaceCreationOpen(false);
          toast({
            title: "Space Listed Successfully!",
            description: "Your space has been listed and is now available for booking.",
          });
          fetchSpaces();
        }}
        onCancel={() => setTieredSpaceCreationOpen(false)}
      />
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

### **2. Enhanced TieredSpaceCreationFlow with Payment-First Approach**

**Added Payment Setup as First Step:**
```typescript
const [step, setStep] = useState<'payment_setup' | 'form' | 'verification' | 'processing'>('payment_setup');
```

**Added Verification Status Checking:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const checkVerificationStatus = async () => {
    if (!user) return;

    setLoadingVerification(true);
    try {
      const status = await tieredVerificationService.getUserVerificationStatus(user.id);
      setVerificationStatus(status);
      
      // If user already has payment method setup, skip to form
      if (status.paymentMethodSetup) {
        setStep('form');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to load verification status:', error);
    } finally {
      setLoadingVerification(false);
    }
  };

  checkVerificationStatus();
}, [user]);
```

**Added Payment Setup Step UI:**
```typescript
if (step === 'payment_setup') {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <CreditCard className="h-5 w-5" />
            Payment Setup Required
          </CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent className="space-y-4">
          <div className="text-center space-y-4">
            <div className="mx-auto w-16 h-16 bg-blue-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
              <CreditCard className="h-8 w-8 text-blue-600" />
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Set Up Payment Method</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                To list your space, we need to verify your identity and address through a payment method. 
                This helps ensure trust and safety for all users.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <Alert>
            <ShieldCheck className="h-4 w-4" />
            <AlertDescription>
              <strong>Why we need this:</strong> Your payment information helps us verify your identity 
              and address, creating a safer marketplace for everyone. You won't be charged until 
              someone books your space.
            </AlertDescription>
          </Alert>

          <div className="flex gap-3">
            <Button 
              onClick={() => setShowPaymentModal(true)}
              className="flex-1"
            >
              <CreditCard className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
              Set Up Payment Method
            </Button>
            <Button 
              variant="outline"
              onClick={onCancel}
            >
              Cancel
            </Button>
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### **3. Added Payment Setup Completion Handler**

```typescript
const handlePaymentSetupComplete = async () => {
  setShowPaymentModal(false);
  
  // Refresh verification status
  try {
    const status = await tieredVerificationService.getUserVerificationStatus(user.id);
    setVerificationStatus(status);
    
    if (status.paymentMethodSetup) {
      setStep('form');
      toast({
        title: "Payment Method Added!",
        description: "Your address has been verified. You can now proceed with listing your space.",
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to refresh verification status:', error);
  }
};
```

### **4. Added Loading State for Verification Check**

```typescript
if (loadingVerification) {
  return (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      <Card>
        <CardContent className="py-8 text-center">
          <div className="mx-auto w-8 h-8 border-2 border-primary border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin mb-4"></div>
          <p>Checking verification status...</p>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎯 **New User Flow**

1. **Click "List Your Driveway"** → Opens TieredSpaceCreationFlow
2. **Payment Setup Step** → Shows payment setup requirement with explanation
