# Tiered Verification System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive tiered verification system that balances user growth with security. The system uses payment verification as the foundation and offers optional ID verification for premium features.

## üèóÔ∏è What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (`20250201000002_add_tiered_verification_system.sql`)

**New Tables:**
- `verification_audit_log` - Tracks all verification events
- `verification_settings` - Configurable thresholds and rules

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `profiles` - Added verification tier, score, badges, fraud flags
- `spaces` - Added verification requirements and approval tracking
- `bookings` - Added renter verification tracking

**Key Features:**
- Automatic tier calculation with PostgreSQL functions
- Audit logging for all verification events
- Configurable settings for thresholds
- Fraud detection and flagging system

### 2. Core Services

#### `TieredVerificationService` (`src/lib/tiered-verification-service.ts`)
- **Tier Management**: Calculate and update verification tiers
- **Address Verification**: Compare billing vs listing addresses
- **Listing Permissions**: Check if user can create specific listings

  return (
    <div>
      <VerificationStatusCard showUpgradeButton={true} />
      {/* ... other dashboard content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Add to Listing Creation

// Expected: 100% match, auto-approve

// Test partial match
billingAddress = "123 Main St, San Francisco, CA 94102"
listingAddress = "456 Oak Ave, San Francisco, CA 94102"
// Expected: 80% match, auto-approve

// Test mismatch
billingAddress = "123 Main St, New York, NY 10001"
