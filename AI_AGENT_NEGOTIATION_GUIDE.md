- Makes minimal concessions

Moderate Strategy (Default):
- Meets buyer halfway on price
- Accepts offers ≥85% of listing if above market avg
- Balanced approach

Conservative Strategy:
- More flexible, moves 60% toward buyer's offer
- Willing to accept lower offers in low demand
- Prioritizes quick deals
```

### **Buyer AI Strategy:**

```typescript
Aggressive Strategy:
- Starts at 85% of market average  
- Pushes for maximum discount
- Willing to walk away

Moderate Strategy (Default):
- Offers 95% of market average
- Fair negotiation approach
- Seeks win-win

Conservative Strategy:
- Willing to pay closer to asking price
- Quick agreement preferred
- Less haggling
```

## 📊 AI Decision Examples

### **Example 1: Great Offer - Auto Accept**
```
Listing Price: $10.00/hr
Buyer Offer: $9.50/hr (95%)
Market Average: $9.00/hr

AI Decision: ✅ ACCEPT
Reasoning: "Offer of $9.50/hr is 95% of listing price. Excellent deal!"
Confidence: 95%
```

### **Example 2: Low Offer - Counter**
```
Listing Price: $10.00/hr  
Buyer Offer: $7.00/hr (70%)
Market Average: $9.00/hr

AI Decision: 💰 COUNTER at $9.25/hr
Reasoning: "Based on market analysis, comparable spaces average $9.00/hr. 
My counter-offer of $9.25/hr reflects fair market value."
Confidence: 75%
```

### **Example 3: Too Low - Reject**
```
Listing Price: $10.00/hr
Buyer Offer: $5.00/hr (50%)
Minimum Price: $7.00/hr

AI Decision: ❌ REJECT
Reasoning: "Offer of $5.00/hr is below minimum acceptable price of $7.00/hr."
Confidence: 90%
```
