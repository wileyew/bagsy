## Security Enforcement

### Address Matching Rules

**Match Criteria (75%+ confidence required):**
- Street number AND street name match
- OR City AND state match  
- OR ZIP code matches

**Approval Logic:**
```typescript
if (verificationConfidence >= 75) {
  status = "✅ Approved to Post"
  canSubmit = true
} else {
  status = "❌ Cannot Post"
  canSubmit = false
}
```

**Cannot Post If:**
- License address ≠ listing address (<75% match)
- No driver's license uploaded
- License extraction failed
- Address fields are empty

---

**Step 2 → Step 1:**
- User can go back to update license
- Re-verifies address after change

**Step 4 → Step 1:**

**Step 4 → Step 3:**

**Step 4 → Step 2:**

## Console Logging

### License Upload (Step 1)
```javascript
Starting driver license upload... {userId, fileName, fileSize}
Available buckets: ["space-photos", "driver-licenses"]
Upload result: {uploadData: {...}, uploadError: null}
Got public URL: https://...
Updating profile with driver license...
✅ Profile updated successfully
```

### Address Verification (Step 2)
```javascript
Address changed, detecting timezone
Verifying listing address against license...
✅ Supabase updated successfully! {extractedAddress, confidence: 95}
✅ Address Verified
```

### Review Page (Step 4)
```javascript
Driver license status: {hasLicense: true, extractedAddress: "123 Main St"}
Address match: true, confidence: 95
✅ User approved to post listing
```

---

## Migration Required

To enable all features, run this SQL in Supabase:

```bash
# Location:
supabase/migrations/20250201000001_add_driver_license_verification.sql

# Via Dashboard:
1. Go to SQL Editor
2. Paste the migration SQL
3. Click Run

# Creates:
- driver_license_url column
- driver_license_verified column
- driver_license_extracted_address column
- driver_license_verification_confidence column
- driver-licenses storage bucket
- RLS policies
```

---

## What Happens Without Migration

**Current Behavior (Migration Not Run):**
- ⚠️ Skips license verification step
- ⚠️ No address verification
- ⚠️ No security enforcement
- ✅ User can still list spaces
- Console shows warnings about missing columns

**After Migration:**
- ✅ Full license verification
- ✅ OCR address extraction
- ✅ Address matching enforcement
- ✅ Cannot post if address doesn't match
- ✅ Complete trust & safety
